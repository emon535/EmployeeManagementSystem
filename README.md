## EM_APIService : Spring Boot Rest API service for Employee Management

- Find the API Documentation from Postman here : [Link](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/3844660/SzKPU1WG?version=latest)
- Run the project and install dependencies.
- Go to postman and follow the API documentation
- I have used in memory Array ( No Database ), You may loose the data once restart the project.
- Cound not write proper unit test and check edge cases for time bound. ( just got few hours to complete )

---
## React Frontend for Employee Management;

- Change the directory to "employee-management-fromtend" and run `npm install` to install the dependencies from `package.json` file.
- Go to  `localhost:3000` and check;


---

*NOTE:*
- Frontend Only shows the data from the locally run server ( `localhost:8080/api/v1/employee`) endpoint.
- Could not complete the  update, edit, and Search feature within the 3/4 hours time for 2 projects.
- Check the API separately with postman. 


> Could not follow the best practices and cleaner code due to time bound. The codebase could be more cleaner and structured with planning.
